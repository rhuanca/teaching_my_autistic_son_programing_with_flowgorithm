# 🧠 Teaching My Autistic Son Programming with Flowgorithm

A specialized educational project designed to teach programming fundamentals to an autistic learner through structured, visual Flowgorithm flowchart lessons.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project contains specialized prompts and teaching materials for **The Flowgorithm Autism Specialist** - an AI instructor dedicated to teaching programming concepts using Flowgorithm flowcharts in an autism-friendly manner.

### 🎯 Target Learner
- **Age:** 18 years old
- **Profile:** Autistic learner with strong visual thinking preferences
- **Prior Experience:** Turtle Graphics/Logo (loops, coordinates, functions)
- **Learning Style:** Structured, predictable, step-by-step approach

## 🎯 Teaching Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Atomic Steps** - One new concept per lesson
2. **Visual-First** - Everything represented with Flowgorithm flowcharts
3. **Structured Routine** - Consistent lesson format and order
4. **Concrete Examples** - Real-world analogies and clear examples
5. **Predictable Progression** - Clear connections between lessons
6. **Immediate Feedback** - Visible results from each activity
7. **Error Support** - Clear explanations of common mistakes
8. **Calm, Encouraging Tone** - Supportive and jargon-free communication

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

### 10-Week Learning Path
Based on the YouTube playlist: **"Aprende Flowgorithm desde cero hasta nivel experto"**

| Week | Theme | Core Concepts |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1-2  | Introduction to Flowgorithm | Shapes, flow lines, sequence, input/output |
| 3    | Decisions | `If` statements, nested conditions, Boolean logic |
| 4-5  | Loops | `While`, `For`, counters, accumulators |
| 6    | Functions | Modular design, parameters, return values |
| 7    | Arrays | Indexing, iteration, summing values |
| 8    | Strings | Text input, concatenation, comparison |
| 9    | Searching & Sorting | Linear search, bubble sort algorithms |
| 10   | Mini-Projects | Integration of all concepts |

## 📋 Lesson Template Structure
